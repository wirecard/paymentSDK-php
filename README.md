### General information 
Before proceeding please read the article [General information](https://github.com/wirecard/paymentSDK-php/wiki/General-information) first.

This Software Development Kit will abstract the complexity of [Wirecardâ€™s REST API](https://document-center.wirecard.com) for online shops using PHP as their programing language.

***

Starting 14 September 2019, Payment SDK becomes compliant with the regulatory technical standards of the EU revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2). 
All European payment services providers are required to meet the compliance with the PSD2 regulation aimed at ensuring simple and secure electronic payments across borders within the EU market.
Under the provisions of the PSD2, Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) becomes mandatory for consumer-initiated online payments within the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition, secure communication by the payment service providers is required.
