### General information 
Before proceeding please read the article [General information](https://github.com/wirecard/paymentSDK-php/wiki/General-information) first.

This Software Development Kit will abstract the complexity of [Wirecardâ€™s REST API](https://document-center.wirecard.com) for online shops using PHP as their programing language.

## Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) Compliance 
The PaymentSDK is **[PSD2](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_PSD2) compliant.**  

The [**P**ayment **S**ervices **D**irective 2 (PSD2)](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_PSD2) aims to reduce fraud in the European e-commerce sector. Most card fraud in Europe happens in card-not-present transactions. For this reason, PSD2 makes [**S**trong **C**ustomer **A**uthentication (SCA)](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_PSD2_SCA) mandatory for consumer-initiated online payments. The new standard authentication method for credit card transactions is [**3DS2**](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_3DS2). It follows the strict SCA requirements.
